# film

I took classes in college on film studies and film production. The height of my filmmaking career was while I was still in college, which was when I co-produced an experimental short film and a feature-length documentary.

I don't have plans to pursue filmmaking at the moment but I still spark a new idea every now and then and I did find myself running around with my camera for a couple months in the summer of 2020 looking for another story.
