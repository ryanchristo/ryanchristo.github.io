I'm a self-taught software developer. I built my first website back in 2012 after graduating from university with a liberal arts degree.

I managed a few websites for small businesses and non-profits but only started pursuing software development as a career in late 2016 after working in technical support and account management at an AI software company.

I became passionate about decentralized web technologies and spent two years working in the "crypto" or "blockchain" space as a software developer, developer relations manager, and protocol researcher.

I'm currently researching use cases for decentralized blockchain protocols that are focused on making a positive social and/or environmental impact.
