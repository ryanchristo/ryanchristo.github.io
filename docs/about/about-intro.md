# about

I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.

I studied liberal arts in college with a focus on classical languages and literature, critical and cultural theory, and film studies/production.

I bounced around several jobs and interests after college but eventually found myself in a career pursuing decentralized blockchain protocols.
